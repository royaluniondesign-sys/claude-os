2. Features overview
3. Pricing page
4. Key integrations

2. Middle-of-funnel: How-to guides, best practices
3. Top-of-funnel: Industry trends, educational content

## Schema Recommendations

| Page Type | Schema Types |
|-----------|-------------|
| Homepage | Organization, WebSite, SoftwareApplication |
| Product/Features | SoftwareApplication, Offer |
| Pricing | SoftwareApplication, Offer (with pricing) |
| Blog | Article, BlogPosting |
| Case Studies | Article, Organization (customer) |
| Documentation | TechArticle |

## Key Metrics to Track

- Organic traffic to pricing page
- Demo/trial signups from organic
- Blog → pricing page conversion
- Comparison page rankings
- Integration page performance

## Comparison & Alternative Pages

Comparison pages are among the highest-converting content types for SaaS, with conversion rates of **4-7%** vs. 0.5-1.8% for standard blog content (35.8% of marketers report comparison content performs "better than ever" per Intergrowth November 2025 survey).

**Recommended page types:**
- `/{product}-vs-{competitor}` — Direct 1:1 comparison
- `/{competitor}-alternative` — Targeting competitor brand searches
- `/compare/{category}` — Category comparison hub
- `/best-{category}-tools` — Roundup-style pages

**Best practices:**
- Include structured comparison tables with pricing, features, pros/cons
- Be factually accurate about competitors — verify claims regularly
- Include customer testimonials from users who switched
- Add FAQ schema for common comparison questions (valuable for AI search)
- Update regularly — stale comparison data damages credibility
- Cross-reference the `seo-competitor-pages` skill for detailed frameworks

**Legal considerations:**
- Nominative fair use generally permits competitor brand mentions for comparison purposes
- Do NOT imply endorsement or affiliation
- Do NOT make false or unverifiable claims about competitor products
- Different jurisdictions have different trademark laws — consult legal counsel

## Competitive Considerations

- Monitor competitor feature releases
- Track competitor content strategies
- Identify keyword gaps in feature coverage
- Watch for new comparison opportunities

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for SaaS
