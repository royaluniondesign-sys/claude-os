# Schema.org Types — Status & Recommendations (February 2026)

**Schema.org Version:** 29.4 (December 8, 2025)

## Format Preference
Always use **JSON-LD** (`<script type="application/ld+json">`).
Google's documentation explicitly recommends JSON-LD over Microdata and RDFa.

**AI Search Note:** Content with proper schema has ~2.5× higher chance of appearing in AI-generated answers (confirmed by Google and Microsoft, March 2025).
