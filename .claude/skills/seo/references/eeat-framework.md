# E-E-A-T Evaluation Framework
## Updated per Google Quality Rater Guidelines — September 11, 2025
## Plus December 2025 Core Update Implications

## Overview

E-E-A-T = **E**xperience, **E**xpertise, **A**uthoritativeness, **T**rustworthiness

Trustworthiness is the most important factor. It is assessed based on the
other three signals plus direct trust indicators.

## CRITICAL: December 2025 Core Update

> **E-E-A-T now applies to ALL competitive queries, not just YMYL.**

The December 2025 core update was described as a "watershed moment" that:
- Extended E-E-A-T evaluation to virtually all competitive queries
- Made author attribution standards tighter across all categories
- Penalized anonymous or generic authorship even for non-YMYL content
- Significantly improved AI content quality detection

**Impact by industry:**
| Industry | Traffic Drops |
|----------|--------------|
| Affiliate sites | 71% average decline |
| Health/YMYL | 67% average decline |
| E-commerce | 52% average decline |

**Key takeaway:** Even entertainment and lifestyle content now requires demonstrated expertise. Generic content no longer ranks.

## YMYL (Your Money or Your Life)

Topics requiring **highest** E-E-A-T standards (but E-E-A-T now matters everywhere):
- Health and safety
- Financial advice and transactions
- Legal information
- News and current events
- **Elections and civic trust** (added Sept 2025)
- **Democratic processes** (added Sept 2025)
- Groups of people (potential for harm)

## September 2025 QRG Updates

### AI Content Assessment
Raters now formally evaluate whether content appears AI-generated:
- AI content is **acceptable** if it demonstrates genuine E-E-A-T
- Low-quality AI content (generic, no unique value) is penalized
- The presence of AI-generated content is not inherently penalizing
- What matters: does the content provide unique value regardless of creation method?

### Markers of Low-Quality AI Content
- Generic phrasing without specificity
- Lack of original insight or unique perspective
- No first-hand experience signals
- Factual inaccuracies
- Repetitive structure across multiple pages
- No author attribution or expertise signals

### New Spam Categories
- **Expired domain abuse**: Buying expired domains for their backlinks
- **Site reputation abuse**: Using reputable site to host low-quality content
- **Scaled content abuse**: Mass-producing content without value

### AI Overview Evaluation
Raters assess quality of AI-generated summaries in search results.

### RSL 1.0 (Really Simple Licensing)
New machine-readable content licensing standard (December 2025) for AI training:
- Backed by: Reddit, Yahoo, Medium, Quora, Cloudflare, Akamai, Creative Commons
- Allows publishers to specify AI licensing terms
- Augments robots.txt for AI-specific permissions

---

## Experience Signals Are Critical Differentiators

The December 2025 update elevated the "Experience" dimension as a key differentiator:
- First-person narrative ("I tested this...", "In my experience...")
- Original photos and screenshots (not stock images)
- Specific examples with verifiable details
- Process documentation showing actual work done

**Why:** AI can generate expertise-sounding content but cannot fabricate genuine experience.
