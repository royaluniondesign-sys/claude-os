# Full Website SEO Audit

## Process

1. **Fetch homepage** — use `scripts/fetch_page.py` to retrieve HTML
2. **Detect business type** — analyze homepage signals per seo orchestrator
3. **Crawl site** — follow internal links up to 500 pages, respect robots.txt
4. **Delegate to subagents** (if available, otherwise run inline sequentially):
   - `seo-technical` — robots.txt, sitemaps, canonicals, Core Web Vitals, security headers
   - `seo-content` — E-E-A-T, readability, thin content, AI citation readiness
   - `seo-schema` — detection, validation, generation recommendations
   - `seo-sitemap` — structure analysis, quality gates, missing pages
   - `seo-performance` — LCP, INP, CLS measurements
   - `seo-visual` — screenshots, mobile testing, above-fold analysis
5. **Score** — aggregate into SEO Health Score (0-100)
6. **Report** — generate prioritized action plan
